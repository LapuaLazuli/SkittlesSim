# SkittlesSimulation
Computer Architecture Final Project By True Soria and Nathan Moreno


CHANGES:
- Per the professor's orders, this is now going to run forever rather than a set number of times; the infinite loop is a feature, not a bug
- Rather than write to a file, this will print out the current sim # and the current average
- The array has been eschewed in favor of a double that constantly get added to that gets divided by the current sim # to find the average
- Besides that the code is pretty much the same
